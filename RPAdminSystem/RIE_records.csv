h0910001,Details of Advanced Research Project,The Chain of Effects from Brand Trust and Brand Affect to Brand Performance: The Role of Brand Loyalty,"The authors examine two aspects of brand loyalty, purchase loyalty and attitudinal loyalty, as linking variables in the chain of effects from brand trust and brand affect to brand performance (market share and relative price). The model includes product-level, category-related controls (hedonic value and utilitarian value) and brand-level controls (brand differentiation and share of voice). The authors compile an aggregate data set for 107 brands from three separate surveys of consumers and brand managers. The results indicate that when the product- and brand-level variables are controlled for, brand trust and brand affect combine to determine purchase loyalty and attitudinal loyalty. Purchase loyalty, in turn, leads to greater market share, and attitudinal loyalty leads to a higher relative price for the brand. The authors discuss the managerial implications of these results.",,,2001

h0910002,Details of Advanced Research Project,Designing crease patterns for polyhedra by composing right frusta,"We propose an original and novel algorithm for the automatic development of crease patterns for certain polyhedra with discrete rotational symmetry by composing right frusta. Unlike existing algorithms, the folded product will conform to the surface of the target polyhedron without external flaps. The crease patterns of frusta are drawn first and then composed by the algorithm to draw the crease pattern of the rotationally symmetric polyhedron. The composition is performed by splitting creases that were folded on pleats from frustum crease patterns. A CAD program has been written to implement the algorithm automatically, allowing users to specify a target polyhedron and generate a crease pattern that folds into it.",,,2012
